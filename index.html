        <h2>Full Disclosure</h2>
       
        <p>'Lost, but with More Squelching' is pretty much an oversimplified and extremely abbreviated synopsis of a popular television show 
          that I was watching while completing this assignment

        <h2>The Beginning, Before Anything Really Happens</h2>
        <p>Basically just two cops talking about their miserable female situation.
          The Punisher's gf does not turn off lights, but is concerned about the environment.
          In his view, this basically makes her a stupid idiot. The other guy has a wife.
          You get the impression that things aren't really going that well, but at least she
          turns off the lights.

        <h2>Still the Beginning, but Something's Definitely Going on Here</h2>
        
        <p>So the cops roll up on some car and are like whoa you're under arrest or something. The guy with the 
          wife who turns off the lights gets shot. He wakes up in the hospital, but its been a min and the clock 
          doesn't work and there's no one there. He finds a child at a gas station but he kills her, then takes 
          a sweet bike to his house. But no one is there. He meets some guy and his kid, then they go their separate
          ways,but you just know theyre going to meet up later on in the series, bc the other guy is a low key 
          skillful actor and shit. Not looking good for the kid tho. The cop gives them a HAM radio and promises that he'll check in everyday at dawn, but I mean, come on, he gonna get sick of that.

        <h2>I'll Never Go Back to [Atlanta,] Georgia</h2>
        <p>The cop figures out that everything is totally effed and hears that they got a vibe in Hotlanta, so he heads that way. Somehow my man gets a horse. He rides into town like the Lone Ranger, but immediately gets swarmed by a crapton of zombies. He locks himself in an abandoned tank and gets rescued by some guy who radios in and is like yo wtf is wrong w you bro? Riding a horse in here like that? You're crazy man. But you should run over here and I'll hook you up. I think they like meet up with the rest of the other guys crew who has been upping on supplies. They lock a racist to the roof, cover themselves in zombie guts, and escape in a sweet mustang and an RV. </p>

        <h2>First Camp</h2>
        <p>
          So they come back victoriously to the camp and guess who's there?? The other cop, the misogynistic one who is the Punisher in Daredevil. Crazy, right? Wrong. What's crazy is cop one, let's call him Rick, his freaking wife and son are there safe and sound! OMG!!!!! Only catch is, Rick's wife and misogynist Punisher guy were definitely umping buglies. Awk!
